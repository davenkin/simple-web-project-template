# Introduction
- This is a simple web template project using vanilla javascript and pure.css, there is no bundler such as webpack but only live-server.
- This template is not recommended for production apps but only for small testing like POC activities.


# Usages
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. Run `./run.sh` to start a local http server, this automatically opens a browser tab with URL http://127.0.0.1/8081
3. Modify files under `src` and you can see changes automatically reflected in the browser
